A long time ago, the wise minds at Bell Labs created a system called **Unix** that *just worked* — for everything. When younger generations built new systems, they followed the **Unix Philosophy**, because once you have the wheel, you don’t reinvent it. Over time, this gave rise to a big family of operating systems called **Unix-like**, all sharing a simple, elegant architecture.

  

**macOS** is Unix-like, **iOS** is Unix-like, and **Linux** is Unix-like. In turn, **ChromeOS**, **Android**, and **SteamOS** are based on Linux. Today, smartphones, Macs, Chromebooks, and over **90% of servers** are powered by this simple, beautiful Unix-like foundation.

## The Microsoft Detour

  

Unfortunately, there was a company called **Microsoft** that decided they were too special to follow the proven path. Instead, they created their own complicated system that:

  

- Centralizes all configuration in a single registry (*a huge security risk*).

- Handles metadata using *alternate data streams* (*a virus playground*).

  

They cornered the office market by bundling elaborate tools for company networks and permissions — so you could avoid basic human interaction, like calling a colleague to press a button. Office workers got used to Windows at work, and then bought the same system for their homes.

## How Gaming Got Locked In

  

The children of these office workers wanted to play games on their PCs. This led Microsoft to dominate the **PC gaming market** as well. Over time, Windows became bloated with extra features to the point where you can only run it properly on a **specialized gaming PC or office server**. Yet laptops are still sold with it by default — meaning you might wait 10 minutes for Outlook to open.

## Locking the Hardware

  

Eventually, Microsoft addressed some of their infamous security holes with a system of encryption and **Secure Boot**, requiring a special chip to be installed on every machine. Manufacturers are forced to include this chip if they want to ship Windows — and customers still ask for it because they’ve never seen anything else.

## The Unix-like Alternatives

  

- **Apple products** let wealthy users bypass Microsoft entirely (at a price).

- **Red Hat Enterprise Linux** gives businesses a secure, stable office OS.

- Power users can disable *Secure Boot* and install **Linux** or **BSD** themselves.

- **Valve** is freeing gamers with the **Proton** compatibility layer, allowing Windows games to run on Linux.

## The Mission

  

The mission of every OS enthusiast is to **preach the superiority of Unix-like architecture** and help people escape the traps of Microsoft. This means guiding newcomers through replacing Windows with **Linux Mint** or **Ubuntu**.

  

You *will* be slandered by Windows loyalists and mocked by the uninformed. Some days, you’ll want to give up and return to “normal.” But then you’ll help your first convert. You’ll see their face light up when their **five-year-old notebook boots in under two minutes** and runs without lag.
